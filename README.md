# Figma-ByteBuilders

This project is a design for the bytebuilders club website for Akshat Singhania. He asked for help redesigning his [site](https://aksinghania.github.io/bytebuilders/) and I volunteered! The design isn’t done, it’s still in its concept phase, but it’s still able to be enjoyed by others, so I decided to scrapbook it. Here’s the share link to the Figma file: <https://www.figma.com/proto/PeUZIuekMLwGStB3GlFEuy/Untitled?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=1-2&viewport=3%2C-218%2C0.31&t=UGtd8ontVpQ9oCjj-1&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2&share=1>
